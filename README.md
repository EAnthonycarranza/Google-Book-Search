# MERN Book Search Engine

![MERN](https://img.shields.io/badge/MERN-Stack-green)

This project is a Book Search Engine built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), refactored to implement a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, replacing the existing RESTful API. The application allows users to search for books, save them to their account, and view their saved books.

## User Story

SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase


## Features

- **Search for Books:** Users can search for books and view the results containing the bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out, with secured password hashing and JWT for user authentication.
- **Save Books:** Logged-in users can save books to their account.
